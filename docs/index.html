    <p>
        I grew up in a small town just like everyone else. I was taught to work hard to earn the things I want from
        life. There is a lot that I want from this life and I plan to do it all. I want to learn so much, something that
        I value is knowledge and that is something that I strive to improve every day of my life. I want to learn new
        skills and grow my knowledge of the world. So just like everyone who grew up in a small town I am going to work
        hard so that I can learn the things I wanna know.
